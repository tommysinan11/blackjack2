        <h2>My learnings</h2>
        <p>During the first few days, I focused on refreshing my knowledge of JavaScript. I did this by watching videos that explained the fundamental concepts of JavaScript, as well as gaining a deeper understanding of the mindset required when writing JS code.</p>
        <p>After that, I delved into specific areas of JavaScript, including how if/else statements work, and I also learned about functions and how they interact with HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>Once I felt confident with the basics, I gradually began working on my own project. I followed a tutorial video that guided me through creating a BlackJack game, which provided a hands-on approach to learning JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Throughout this process, I discovered that my most effective working method is to focus for 20 minutes at a time, followed by a short break. This approach allows me to return to the project with a fresh perspective and renewed focus.</p>
